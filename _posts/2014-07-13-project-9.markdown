description: As a Graduate Assistant at Stevens Institute of Technology, I worked with the Registrar's office to tabulate and document the progress of classroom management on a weekly basis, by submitting reports facilitated by MS Excel's reporting and data analysis tools to the Vice Provost of the institution. In addition, I used my critical thinking skills to manage risk and prioritization issues to solve various issues by collaborating with facilities management. I worked with my team and also trained three new additions, ensuring that the integrity of our system and its management is maintained. My work is commended by my manager on my <a href = https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-pendyala/> LinkedIn profile. </a>
