description: I wrote a <a href = http://bit.ly/2CQ054O> whitepaper </a> to analyze the impact of analytics and how established organizations can incorporate it into their differentiation strategy. I used the data of current industry trends to plot visualizations using Tableau and Python's Matplotlib. Based on Thomas Davenport's "Competing on Analytics", the whitepaper is titled "The Speedbumps to Competing on Analytics."
