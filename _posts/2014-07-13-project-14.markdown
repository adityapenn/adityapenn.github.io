As a volunteer for <a href = http://makeadiff.in> Make a Difference </a>, I taught fourth-grader orphans Math and English on the weekends. I actively spread environmental-friendliness awareness as a volunteer for the <a href = https://gogreeninitiative.org/wp/> Go-Green Initiative </a>, and I helped spread mental health awareness as a <a href = https://www.stevens.edu/directory/counseling-and-psychological-services/peer-educators> Peer Educator </a> for Stevens Institute of Technology.
